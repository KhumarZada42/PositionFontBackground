    <p class="p1">
        When you visit a website, the design elements you see were created by a front-end developer.
        Contrast this with back-end developers, who work to develop the behind-the-scenes portions of a website or
        application, like data storage, security, site performance, or other server-side functions.

    <p class="text">
        A front-end developer builds the front-end portion of websites and web applications—that is, the part that users
        actually see and interact with.A front-end developer creates websites and applications using web languages such
        as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allow users to access and interact with the site or app.

        What does a front-end developer do?
        Front-end developers create the user interface (UI) that determines what each part of a site or application does
        and how it will look.

        If someone wanted to build a website, for example, they might hire a front-end developer to create the site's
        layout. The front-end developer determines where to place images, what the navigation should look like, and how
        to present the site. Much of their work involves ensuring the appearance and layout of the site or application
        is easy to navigate and intuitive for the user.

        "I've always found crafting polished user interactions that surprise and delight users to be the most rewarding
        and engaging task," says Mari Batilando, a software engineer at Meta. "In order to do this, you need to both
        have an eye for detail and a rock-solid understanding of the platform."

        Front-end developer salary and job prospects
        The average base salary for a front-end developer in the US was $88,558 in May 2022, according to Glassdoor.
        Factors like education level, experience, or certifications may affect how much you earn.

        Front-end development is a career that is expected to continue being in demand for years to come. The US Bureau
        of Labor Statistics reports that web developer jobs in the US should grow by 13 percent from 2020 to 2030, which
        is well above the overall average of 8 percent for all jobs [1].

        Benefits of being a front-end developer
        The demand and flexibility of this position mean that there are many career opportunities available across
        various industries and locations. Whether that means working with a non-profit organization, starting your own
        freelance business, or being an in-house developer for a company, you’ll likely have the chance to find a role
        that fits your interests.

        The computer-heavy nature of the job also means plenty of opportunities to work remotely. Being a front-end
        developer can mean being able to work for companies across the country—or even the globe—from the comfort of
        your home.

        constantly evolving to incorporate new technology, front-end development can reward those who like to learn new

        solid understanding of them is crucial for creating page structures.

        code, is critical to allow you to make changes without starting over. Understanding how to use many different
        software development tools is a building block to a successful career.

        In addition to understanding the technology that drives a website, having specific workplace skills can make you
